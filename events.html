            Energetica Exhibition on Loan: On loan from the NEMO Science Museum
            in Amsterdam, the Energetica exhibition is coming to the Community
            Science Museum. It’s a series of installations that allow visitors
            to experience the power of the elements as we harness them. From
            solar energy powering lighting, to ‘Wind Island’ that shows how
            turbines are able to use and control wind to create power.
